Added a dedicated button to move up a directory that was moved into. Next would be to spruce up the GUI and to 
add conditions if values are mismatched and things of that nature.

Added directory fuctionality, in that, if one file was a directory, a new windows with new buttons were made. This is the same throughout all levels. Next would be a way to go back to another set of buttons, or make new windows instead of overwriting buttons.

Need to come up with good way to save what files have been opend or not. Maybe adding filepath to a text file, and when choosing a directory, run against text file to find any similar paths and throw those out. One buton press(read), add that file's path to the text file. The question then becomes, will this only be limited to looking in a single folder, or perhaps larger, nested directories?

Figured out a basic form of file history. Nothing special, mostly clunky and ugly, but for now, it gets the job done well enough.
