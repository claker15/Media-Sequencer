-Need to come up with good way to save what files have been opend or not. Maybe adding filepath to a text file, and when choosing a directory, run against text file to find any similar paths and throw those out. One buton press(read), add that file's path to the text file. The question then becomes, will this only be limited to looking in a single folder, or perhaps larger, neted directories?
