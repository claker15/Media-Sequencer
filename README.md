Features to add: If  a file is a directory, on button hit, create a new button windows with its contents. This could be repeated as needed.

Need to come up with good way to save what files have been opend or not. Maybe adding filepath to a text file, and when choosing a directory, run against text file to find any similar paths and throw those out. One buton press(read), add that file's path to the text file. The question then becomes, will this only be limited to looking in a single folder, or perhaps larger, nested directories?

Figured out a basic form of file history. Nothing special, mostly clunky and ugly, but for now, it gets the job done well enough.
